AI Character/Robot
==================

AI Overview
-----------

AI Character/Robot is an actor controlled via `BP_ROSAIController`. It has preset
movements such as pick, drop, and navigation. The primary purpose of these actors
is to simulate humans, non-robot components such as manually controlled forklifts,
or off-the-shelf robots that you won't develop but exists in the environment.
These actors help simulate robot interactions with dynamic objects in environments like warehouses.

Basic AI functionality such as pick/drop/move is implemented via behavior tree in BP_RRROSAIController.
The main reason to implement logic in controller instead of actor is to
support both child class of RRBaseRobot and Character.

RRAIRobotROSController is parent class of BP_RRROSAIController which has
implementention of UE navigation system movement functionality in C++. Those primitive
API’s are used from behavior tree in BP_RRROSAIController.

BP_RRAIBaseRobot and BP_ROSSimpleCharacter uses BP_ROSAIController as controller. It
is expected to overwrite function/behavior in those child actor classes to implement custom
pick/drop/etc actions.

Basic Behaviors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

AI characters can move using two methods:

- **UE Navigation System Movement**:
    Utilizes Unreal Engine's navigation system, requiring a navigation mesh in the map.

- **Direct Movement**:
    Uses `SetActorLocation` and `SetActorRotation` for linear and rotational movement, often for tasks such as picking up or dropping objects.

Combination Behaviors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **Auto Movement**:
    The robot can move randomly or sequentially through predefined goal sequences, or move randomly within a defined area.

    - **SEQUENCE**: Moves repeatedly through a given `GoalSequence`.
    - **RANDOM_SEQUENCE**: Selects a random destination from `GoalSequence`.
    - **RANDOM_AREA**: Selects random destinations within a specified bounding box.

- **Pick/Drop**:
    Combines UE navigation system movement with direct movement
    (forward/backward) to approach or depart from the target payload or point, lifting
    up or down, and attaching or detaching the object. There is also an option to
    move to another approach location before moving to the target location, which helps
    pawn to approach the target from specific direction.

- **General Action**:
    A virtual event that can be customized in child classes. The action is
    triggered by a JSON string argument and allows for flexible custom behavior.


Behavior Trees
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**BT_ROS2Agent**
`BT_ROS2Agent` is a base behavior tree that switches between navigation, pick, drop,
and general actions. In the navigation part, it switches Auto Movement modes depending
on the current mode. In the pick/drop part, it includes sub-behavior trees in
`PickImpl/DropImpl`, which are set in the `PickImplBehavior/DropImplBehavior`
variables of `BP_RRROSAIController`.

BP_RRROSAIController
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

BP_RRROSAIController is a child class of RRAIRobotROSController and has implementation
for pick, drop, and other actions in addition to actor movements. These actions are implemented
in a behavior tree, and can be customized via the behavior tree in child classes.

Pick/Drop actions include an optional parameter for approaching a location before starting the
pick/drop action. This allows the actor to approach the target object from a specific direction.

If the target payload is a child class of BP_PayloadBase, the defined approach locations in
BP_PayloadBase can also be used.

The general action is an interface to execute actions specific to the actor. The argument to the
general action is a JSON string, which is parsed and the action is implemented in child classes.

AI Pawn
------------------

AI Character/Robot is a actor which is controlled by RRAIRobotROSController. Since most of
AI feature is implemented in RRAIRobotROSController, actor class mainly just has bridge api to
call controller interfaces.

General action is a interface to execute action specific to the actor. Argument to general action
is Json string and expected to be parsed and action implemented in child

   UE API which bridge to BP_RRAIRobotROSController

BP_RRAIBaseRobot
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

BP_RRAIBaseRobot is a child class of RRBaseRobot and has a bridge interface to
RRAIRobotROSController. It provides basic movement and pick/drop functionality, along with
the ability to customize general actions.

Example child classes are available in the `rclUE-Examples <https://github.com/yuokamoto/rclUE-Examples>`_
and `UEROSAssets <https://github.com/yuokamoto/UEROSAssets/tree/ai_robots2>`_
repositories. The warehouse map in rclUE-Examples includes examples of BP_CounterFork and BP_Track.

- `BP_CounterFork <https://github.com/yuokamoto/UEROSAssets/blob/ai_robots2/Content/BP_CounterFork.uasset>`_: Demonstrates pick/drop actions.
- `BP_Track <https://github.com/yuokamoto/UEROSAssets/blob/ai_robots2/Content/BP_Track.uasset>`_: Implements general actions, such as opening/closing containers via
  general_action.

BP_ROSSimpleCharacter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

BP_ROSSimpleCharacter is a child class of Character and interfaces with
RRAIRobotROSController. It provides customizable behavior, actions, and animation control for
AI robots or workers in Unreal Engine environments.

Example child classes are available in the `rclUE-Examples <https://github.com/yuokamoto/rclUE-Examples>`_
and `UEROSAssets <https://github.com/yuokamoto/UEROSAssets/tree/ai_robots2>`_
repositories. The warehouse map in rclUE-Examples includes BP_ROSCharacter.


`BP_ROSCharacter <https://github.com/yuokamoto/UEROSAssets/blob/ai_robots2/Content/Character/BP_ROSCharacter.uasset>`_
is a child class of BP_ROSSimpleCharacter. BP_ROSCharacter is example
of implement custom ROS enabled character.

- **Custom Pick/Drop Behavior**: Demonstrated in BT_ROSCharacterPick and BT_ROSCharacterDrop.
- **Custom Animations**: Animation Blueprints such as `ABP_RRManny` and `SKM_Manny_CtrlRig`
  are used to control animations during pick/drop actions.
- **Payload Interaction**: BP_CharacterPayloadBox has PickHandles for grasping and handles for
  determining the direction for payload placement.

It is expected that users will create child classes to override behavior, animations, and meshes
as needed for specific use cases.
